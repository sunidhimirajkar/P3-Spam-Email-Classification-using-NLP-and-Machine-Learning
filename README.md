# P3-Spam-Email-Classification-using-NLP-and-Machine-Learning
<h1>Project Description</h1>h1>
<p>This project focuses on building a robust spam email classification system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Machine Learning models. The system is capable of differentiating between spam and non-spam (ham) emails by analyzing the text content.</p>
<h1>The Problem</h1>
<p>The increasing volume of spam emails—unwanted, unsolicited, and often malicious—poses significant challenges, including security threats, reduced productivity, and resource wastage.This project aims to develop a robust and scalable spam email classification system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques. The primary goal is to automatically distinguish between spam (unwanted or unsolicited emails, often containing advertisements, phishing attempts, or malicious content) and ham (legitimate, desired emails). This involves analyzing the content of emails to detect patterns or characteristics that define spam versus legitimate communication.</p>
<h1>Features</h1>
<p>Automated Spam Detection: Classifies messages into spam and non-spam (ham) categories based on their textual content, enhancing email filtering efficiency.
Text Preprocessing Pipeline: Implements NLP techniques like lowercasing, stop-word removal, stemming/lemmatization, and tokenization to clean and prepare text data.
Feature Extraction: Converts text data into numerical features using methods such as:
TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)
Bag of Words (BoW)
Word embeddings like Word2Vec (optional for advanced models).
Machine Learning Models: Leverages algorithms like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for training and classification.
Performance Evaluation: Evaluates models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC curve to ensure reliability.
Deployment-Ready Application: Includes a Flask or Streamlit-based web interface for real-time email or SMS spam classification.</p>
<h1>Technologies Used</h1>
